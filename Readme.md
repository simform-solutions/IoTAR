In this prototypes following software and libraries used

*  OpenCV
*  Unity
*  Vuforia 

## OpenCV:

OpenCV full form is Open Source Computer Vision Library.OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.It's originally developed by intel.OpenCV is written in C++ but its wrappers available in different programming languages such as Python, Java, c#, Perl and Ruby.OpenCV supported cross-platform feature.OpenCV support deep learning platform such as Tensorflow, Pytorch and caffe.

OpenCV is very useful for perform real time image processing.

This following types of technique provided by OpenCV for perform image processing.  

* Image Thresholding
* Canny Edge Detection
* Contours in Opencv
* Feature detection in Image
* Hough line Transform 
* Image Gradients & many more

OpenCV provide following machine Learning algorithm.

* K-Nearest Neighbours 
* Support Vector Machines
* K-means Clustering

We can build any type of computer vision project using OpenCV.We can also build object detection and face detection based project using opencv.

## Unity:

Unity software provide all support for building high quality 3d and 2d games.Unity support C# scripting language.Unity is cross-platform supported we can deploy game by unity on android,ios mobile devices and AR/VR devices.Unity provide 3D,2D objects and components tools for design 2d and 3d scenes.Unity also very helpful for build 3d scenes for Augmeneted Reality and Virtual Reality.

## Vuforia:

Vuforia is an Augmented Reality software developement kit for build Augmented Reality application for mobile devices.Vuforia SDK can be integrated with Unity game engine for build AR application with unity.We can design scene for AR application using unity.Vuforia uses computer vision technology for recognize target image and place 3d object on it in AR view.Vuforia provide api in C++ and Java programming languages.
